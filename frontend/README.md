I developed a fully functional and feature-rich React application based on the given assignment requirements. Below are the key features implemented:

--> Pre-authorized API Usage , no need to login(authenticate)

--> Custom Logging Middleware , without console.log.

--> And also I develop a Client-Side Redirection via React Router by allowing single page application

--> As well Client-Side Validation for all inputs

---> Optional Expiry Times, defaulting to 30 minutes (here we can give any custom url u want)

--> Aslo we having the Custom Shortcodes support

==> I entirely developed the appliction by Styled using Material UI components

Run on the port ==>  Runs on http://localhost:3000
